**Tabular Comparison**

| Prompt Style | Structure/Format                                           | Detail Level                                           | Adherence to Provided Conventions                      | Complexity                                           | Key Strengths / Weaknesses                                                                                   |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fancy        | Uses a layered structure (Task model + TaskManager), includes docstrings, pydantic validation, and a thorough explanation. | High (includes type hints, pydantic, docstrings, examples) | Strong (matches many of the “Baseline Conventions,” especially type hints & docstrings) | Moderate to High (UUIDs for IDs, pydantic BaseModel, well-documented methods) | Strengths: Very polished, robust data validation, good code organization. Weaknesses: Possibly more verbose than needed for simpler use cases. |
| Plain        | A straightforward OOP approach with two classes (Task & TaskManager), plus a usage example in main. | Medium (limited type annotations, docstrings are short, no pydantic) | Moderate (follows simpler naming and structure, but minimal advanced features like type checking)        | Low to Moderate (classic OOP approach without validations) | Strengths: Easy to read, simpler approach. Weaknesses: No type hints, no advanced validation, somewhat minimal detail in docstrings.            |
| Partial      | Also demonstrates an OOP approach with a Task and TaskManager, includes inline usage with main. | Medium (missing advanced pydantic usage but has docstrings, minimal type usage) | Moderate (follows naming conventions, but partial coverage of advanced guidelines like typed fields) | Low to Moderate (still uses a list of tasks, minimal checks) | Strengths: Simple, cohesive, and instructions remain clear. Weaknesses: Lacks robust validation and some advanced features (e.g., type hints for clarity). |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. **Which prompt style gives the best results overall?**  
   The “fancy” prompt style yields the most comprehensive and robust solution. It leverages pydantic for validation, includes detailed docstrings, type hints, and even uses UUIDs for task identification. This aligns closely with best practices described in the baseline conventions, especially regarding validation and typed fields.

2. **What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?**  
   - The level of detail in code comments and docstrings is higher in the fancy style, while the plain and partial styles are more minimal.  
   - The fancy style implements data validation (pydantic), while the plain and partial rely on conventional class structures without specialized validation.  
   - The fancy style uses explanatory docstrings and type hints comprehensively; however, the plain and partial prompts only include basic or minimal docstrings and incomplete or no type hints.

3. **What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?**  
   - All solutions introduce a dedicated class (e.g., Task) and a manager/controller class (e.g., TaskManager).  
   - Each solution offers similar core functionality: add tasks, remove tasks, and mark tasks as complete (though the fancy and partial approaches use IDs/indexes differently).  
   - All three maintain straightforward OOP structures, making them easy to follow.
