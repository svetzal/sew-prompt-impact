| **Detail / Scope**            | Comprehensive, uses data validation, docstrings, and type hints. | Moderate detail, includes classes, minimal docstrings. | Minimal functionality and structure. |
| **Code Complexity**           | Medium‑high (uses pydantic, validation decorators).       | Moderate (classes but no external libraries).    | Very low (simple classes only).       |
| **Additional Libraries**      | Uses pydantic for validation and type hints.             | No external libraries.                           | No external libraries.                |
| **Type Hints & Validation**   | Strict type coverage and validation with pydantic.        | No explicit type hints; no validation.           | No type hints; no validation.         |
| **Docstrings & Documentation**| Google‑style docstrings throughout; detailed explanation. | Basic docstrings for methods.                    | Minimal or no docstrings.             |
| **Example Usage**             | Demonstrates usage in a guarded `if __name__ == "__main__"` section. | Shows usage in `__main__` area.                | Shows usage in `__main__` area.       |
| **Overall Readability**       | High clarity and explicit comments.                       | Fairly straightforward.                          | Very straightforward, less formal.    |

## Qualitative Analysis

### 1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

- **Fancy Prompt**: This generally produces the most robust solution. It uses pydantic for data validation, provides explicit type hints, and includes thorough docstrings. This is beneficial for projects that demand strict validation, clarity in function contracts, and well‑structured documentation.

### 2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

- **Library Use**: 
  - The **Fancy** output leverages pydantic for model validation and typed arguments.  
  - The **Medium** and **Plain** outputs rely purely on built‑in Python features.
- **Documentation & Docstrings**: 
  - The **Fancy** prompt includes comprehensive Google‑style docstrings throughout.  
  - The **Medium** prompt has basic docstrings.  
  - The **Plain** prompt includes little to no docstring coverage.
- **Type Hints**: 
  - The **Fancy** version provides full type hints using pydantic.  
  - The **Medium** and **Plain** versions do not use Python type hints.
- **Structure & Complexity**: 
  - The **Fancy** prompt’s code is more detailed and modular, ensuring tasks are validated upon creation.  
  - The **Medium** is simpler, with a single `Task` model class and a `TaskManager`.  
  - The **Plain** version is barebones, focusing just on essential features without extras.

### 3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

- **Basic Task Management**: All three outputs handle adding, removing, listing (and in some cases completing) tasks in a list.
- **Class‑Based Approach**: Each output defines a `Task` class and a `TaskManager` class, aligning with a clear object‑oriented approach.
- **Simple Usage Example**: Each solution includes a demonstration in the `__main__` block illustrating how to add tasks, list tasks, remove tasks, etc.
- **Core Goal Fulfillment**: All three produce a Python module that manages a task list per the original request—differing mostly in how extensive the final result is.
