## Qualitative Analysis

### 1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
- The **fancy** prompt style generally produces the most robust, professionally structured, and feature-rich code. It applies advanced Python features (pydantic for validation, docstrings, type hints) and clarifies the code’s intentions. This style might be ideal for production-grade applications or scenarios where strict validation and clarity are paramount.

### 2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?
1. **Validation & Type Hints**  
   • Fancy uses `pydantic.BaseModel` and enforces strict validation as well as thorough type hints.  
   • Plain omits advanced validation and largely omits type hints.  
   • Partial uses Python’s standard `dataclass` and includes minimal type usage, but not to the same extent as fancy.

2. **Feature Completeness**  
   • Fancy code includes filtering for completed tasks, update operations, and docstrings describing each operation.  
   • Plain version focuses on core operations (add, list, complete, remove) with minimal extra structure.  
   • Partial includes basic CRUD and filtering but doesn’t utilize a specialized library for validation.

3. **Design Principles & Complexity**  
   • Fancy meticulously follows a wide variety of principles (immutability, docstrings, small increments, type coverage).  
   • Plain emphasizes simplicity, minimal overhead, and easy readability for small codebases.  
   • Partial strikes a balance—some best practices (like immutability in dataclasses) and a clear approach, but not as many advanced patterns as fancy.

### 3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?
1. **Core Task Management**  
   All three contain fundamental operations: add tasks, list tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.  
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**  
   Each approach keeps data representation and business logic (task management) organized within classes or structures.  
3. **Basic Flexibility**  
   All outputs can be easily extended (via CLI, saving/loading from files, additional fields, etc.).  
4. **Fundamental Code Readability**  
   Even though they differ in complexity, all styles present readable code that a human programmer can follow.
