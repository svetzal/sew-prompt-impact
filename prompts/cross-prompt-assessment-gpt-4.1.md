| Prompt Style | Code Complexity | Use of Type Hints & pydantic | Adherence to Styling Conventions | Feature Set | Overall Presentation |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Fancy        | Medium-High    | Yes                          | Very High (flake8, black, etc.)   | Rich (add, complete, remove, count, plus robust error handling) | Polished, methodical, detailed docstrings |
| Plain        | Low            | No                           | Moderate (less detailed conventions) | Basic (add, remove, complete, list) | Direct, minimalistic, simpler style |

1) Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

The “fancy” prompt style produces a more robust, polished module that follows strict coding principles: it has type hints, uses pydantic models, and demonstrates thorough adherence to formatting and testing standards. As a result, it balances readability, correctness, and maintainability. The “plain” prompt style is simpler and easier to grasp initially, but it does not provide type annotations or stronger validation, making it less ideal in production scenarios involving complex data or collaborative teams.

2) What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

• Strictness and Structure:  
  – The “fancy” style enforces type hints, pydantic for data validation, docstrings, and linting/formatting principles; it also includes error handling in a more Pythonic way.  
  – The “plain” style is more direct, focusing on minimal functionality with fewer safeguards and simpler design patterns.  

• Additional Features:  
  – The “fancy” style supports tasks with optional descriptions, toggling completion status via a method on the data model, and a more explicit approach to error handling.  
  – The “plain” style demonstrates a simpler class design with straightforward methods but omits advanced usage of Python’s typing and pydantic.  

3) What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

• Core Functionality:  
  – Both generate functional code to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove tasks.  
  – Both provide a means of listing tasks, including filtering for completed vs. incomplete tasks.  

• Usability and Example Usage:  
  – Each style supplies an example on how to instantiate the manager and perform basic operations.  
  – Both illustrate a similar logic flow, looping through tasks in an in-memory list and updating their attributes.
