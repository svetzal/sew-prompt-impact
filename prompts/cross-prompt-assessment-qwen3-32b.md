## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The “fancy” style tends to yield the most thorough and production-ready solution, complete with Pydantic-based data modeling, exhaustive type hints, and comprehensive docstrings. This approach is more aligned with strictly enforced code quality and validation requirements. If the goal is to meet stringent engineering guidelines (e.g., 100% type coverage, advanced validation, neat docs) and to ensure the code scales well in a larger production environment, “fancy” provides the strongest foundation.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Type Safety and Validation:  
     – “Fancy” uses Pydantic for robust data validation and type checks.  
     – “Plain” uses neither explicit type hints nor a validation library, focusing on simplicity.  
     – “Partial” uses standard Python type hints for function signatures but does not employ Pydantic.

   • Code Structure:  
     – “Fancy” separates data (Task as a Pydantic BaseModel) from manager logic (TaskManager) and heavily documents the design rationales.  
     – “Plain” merges logic in a more compact manner, with a single class approach to tasks plus dictionary usage.  
     – “Partial” embraces immutability in its Task class and includes a functional style approach (e.g., mark_complete returns a new Task instance).

   • Documentation Style:  
     – “Fancy” outputs thorough docstrings in a consistent Google-style format.  
     – “Plain” is still documented but in a more minimal, procedural style.  
     – “Partial” remains fairly well documented but does not follow a codified docstring style as precisely as “fancy” does.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Core Functionality:  
     – All generate a Python module to add tasks, remove tasks, list tasks (often filtered), and mark tasks complete.

   • Clarity and Readability:  
     – Each solution strives to maintain straightforward code that is easy to follow, although the specifics differ (e.g., class-based dictionaries vs. Pydantic vs. immutability).

   • Adherence to Basic Principles:  
     – All demonstrate “Code is communication,” providing readable function/class names.  
     – All keep their design relatively simple, avoiding large amounts of boilerplate or unnecessary complexity.

Overall, each style provides a valid approach, ranging from the robust, validation-heavy “fancy” output to the lean, minimal “plain” style. The “partial” style strikes a balance by introducing immutability and typed methods without the overhead of Pydantic.
