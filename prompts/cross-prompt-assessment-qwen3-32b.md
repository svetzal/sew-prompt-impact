## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   The "fancy" style provides a more comprehensive, robust, and production-ready solution. It follows best practices (type hints, docstrings, pydantic validation, enumerations for status handling) and offers greater clarity on task lifecycle and timestamps. However, for quick scripting or simpler use cases, the "plain" style is perfectly serviceable. Ultimately, the "fancy" style’s extensive usage of Python features and strong validation mechanisms would likely be considered the “best” for long-term maintainability and explicitness.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • The "fancy" output uses pydantic for model validation, Enums for task status, and docstrings in Google format. It also updates and tracks timestamps automatically.  
   • The "plain" output uses a simpler class with just a few attributes; task details are updated by direct attribute manipulation. It doesn’t enforce type hints, doesn’t rely on an external library like pydantic, and uses a straightforward approach for listing tasks.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Both solutions focus on the same core functionality: adding tasks, retrieving tasks, marking tasks as done, and removing tasks.  
   • Both maintain an internal data structure (either a list or dictionary) to store tasks.  
   • Both solutions are organized around a central “manager” class that encapsulates task creation and retrieval functionality. 

Overall, both the “fancy” and “plain” prompts succeed in creating a functional task manager module. The difference lies largely in the level of formality, additional tooling, and Pythonic conventions applied in the “fancy” version.
