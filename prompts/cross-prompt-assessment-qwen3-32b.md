**Tabular Comparison (Super-Condensed)**

| Prompt Style | Code Complexity | Documentation & Explanation | Top Feature(s)                       | Potential Gaps                    | Strengths                                      |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| fancy       | High            | Extensive docstrings, enumerations, explanations | Immutable tasks with Pydantic + detailed status | May be over-engineered for small projects | Strong conformance to best practices, thorough validation |
| medium      | Moderate        | In-code comments, shorter docstrings | Functional core (pure functions) + TaskManager shell | Not as much validation as Pydantic approach | Good balance of clarity, testability, and modular design |
| plain       | Relatively High (due to added persistence) | Less structured docstrings, simpler explanations | JSON persistence + advanced fields (priority, timestamps) | Lacks consistent validation or type hints | Straightforward usage, easily extensible with file I/O |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. **Which prompt style gives the best results overall?**  
   • The "fancy" prompt style yields the most thorough solution in terms of validation, documentation, and clarity. It aligns well with robust engineering practices (e.g., using Pydantic for validation, enumerations for statuses, and detailed docstrings). If a project requires strict type safety, maturity of data modeling, and strong readability, the fancy style stands out.  
   • However, the fancy style may be overkill for very small or quick scripts. In simpler scenarios, the "medium" or "plain" styles might suffice.

2. **What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?**  
   • The "fancy" style heavily emphasizes:
     – Immutability (frozen Pydantic models).  
     – Granular documentation and best-practice enumerations.  
     – Thorough justification of design decisions.  
   • The "medium" style focuses on:
     – A mix of functional and imperative styles.  
     – Dataclasses for simpler data structures.  
     – A clearly separated “core logic” (pure functions) and “shell” (TaskManager) for state management.  
   • The "plain" style includes:
     – An object-oriented design with a single class for tasks and a manager class that exposes operations.  
     – Additional features like JSON persistence and more advanced fields (priority, timestamps).  
     – Less formal validation or typed modeling.

3. **What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?**  
   • All three outputs introduce a Task or equivalent entity that captures basic details (description, status, ID).  
   • Each solution implements core CRUD-like management functionality: adding tasks, removing tasks, and marking tasks as complete.  
   • They all use Python classes or dataclasses to represent tasks, though the approach to immutability and validation differs.  
   • Documentation is present in each approach, though the depth and style vary.  
   • Each solution demonstrates an awareness of code readability and maintainability, aligned with the guiding principles provided.
