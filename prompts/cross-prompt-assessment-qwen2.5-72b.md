### Super-Condensed Comparison Table

| Prompt Style | Code Complexity        | Use of Pydantic/Advanced Features | Documentation & Type Hints | Overall Structure          | Strengths                                                  | Weaknesses                                                        |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fancy**   | High (classes, pydantic) | Yes (pydantic, UUID)             | Extensive (Google-style docstrings, type hints) | Elaborate (with constants, example usage, etc.) | Rich model featuring robust validation and clear docstrings | Potential overkill for simple tasks; slightly more verbose         |
| **Plain**   | Low (basic classes)    | No                                | Minimal (no type hints)    | Straightforward           | Easy to read; minimal boilerplate                         | Lacks formal validation; no explicit type hints                   |
| **Partial** | Moderate (classes, UUID) | No (UUID is used but no pydantic) | Moderate (docstrings but no type hints) | Balanced                 | Clean structure, some docstrings, simpler than fancy      | Missing strict type hints and validation provided by pydantic      |

### Qualitative Analysis

1. **Which prompt style gives the best results overall?**  
   - The “fancy” prompt style yields the most feature-rich and formally correct solution. It leverages pydantic for data validation, includes type hints everywhere, and follows a robust code style with docstrings adhering to Google’s format. This makes it particularly suitable for production-grade scenarios where validation, clarity, and maintainability are paramount.

2. **What aspects of the model’s response differ between the different prompt styles?**  
   - The “fancy” output:
     • Uses pydantic to enforce schema validation.  
     • Employs thorough docstrings and type annotations (including stricter mypy compliance).  
     • Implements advanced features like constants for a max-task cap and an example usage that is more detailed.  

   - The “plain” output:
     • Is simpler, omitting type hints and advanced validation.  
     • Focuses on just the core functionality of adding, removing, and marking tasks.  
     • Shows minimal documentation and no usage of external libraries.  

   - The “partial” output:
     • Sits between “fancy” and “plain” in complexity. It uses `uuid` for task IDs but does not incorporate pydantic.  
     • Has basic docstrings but lacks full type hints or extensive code style references.  
     • Maintains clarity but without stricter enforcement of data validation.  

3. **What aspects of the model’s response are consistent across all prompt styles?**  
   - All three styles:
     • Provide a `Task` or equivalent class encapsulating individual tasks.  
     • Offer basic CRUD-like operations (add, remove, list, and update/mark tasks) within a `TaskManager` or a similar management class.  
     • Keep the code relatively straightforward, focusing on fundamental task management functionality.  
     • Present an example or usage pattern that shows how to instantiate and work with the task manager.
