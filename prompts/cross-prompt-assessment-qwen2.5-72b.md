## Super-Condensed Comparison Table

| Prompt Style | Structure & Design                         | Feature Set                                    | Code Clarity & Maintenance | Testing Included?          | Unique Strength                               | Potential Weakness                           |
|-------------:|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **fancy**    | Presents classes plus Pydantic model        | Rich type hints, docstrings, data validation   | Very high (type-safe, doc'd) | Includes example usage snippet, no dedicated test suite in snippet | Thorough & modern (Pydantic, docstrings)      | May be too detailed for simpler use cases    |
| **medium**   | Class-based with Python dataclass           | Good coverage (add, list, remove, complete, etc.) | High (explicit, well-structured)  | Contains full `unittest` coverage in snippet | Balanced approach (dataclass, testing)        | Lacks advanced validation (no Pydantic)      |
| **plain**    | Basic classes only (no dataclass/pydantic) | Covers main functionality (add, list, remove, etc.) | Moderate (straightforward, minimal) | No dedicated test suite (just inline usage) | Easiest to read, minimal dependencies        | No type hints, no automated validation       |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
   - The “fancy” style delivers the most comprehensive and modern approach (uses Pydantic for validation, includes type hints everywhere, and provides thorough docstrings). From a professional standpoint, it often yields robust software engineering practices out of the box. However, the “medium” style is also strong, providing a balance of simplicity and thoroughness, and even includes a dedicated test suite. In terms of completeness and enterprise-readiness, “fancy” likely stands out; in terms of approachability and built-in testing workflow, “medium” is appealing.

2. What aspects of the model’s response differ between the different prompt styles?
   - • “Fancy”: Focuses heavily on advanced Python features (Pydantic, strict type hints, docstrings).  
   - • “Medium”: Relies on Python’s dataclass, includes a more explicit example of unit testing, but does not incorporate Pydantic.  
   - • “Plain”: Sticks to simple classes, minimal design, no advanced features like docstrings, type hints, or data validation.  

   The primary differences are the sophistication of validation, structure of the classes, presence of docstrings, and testing approaches.

3. What aspects of the model’s response are consistent across all prompt styles?
   - All styles consistently implement the core operations for a typical task manager: adding tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as completed (or incomplete), and removing tasks. They each show how to use the module in a straightforward manner, typically through a small demo in the “main” section. They also share a focus on clarity in code that represents tasks and a manager class.
