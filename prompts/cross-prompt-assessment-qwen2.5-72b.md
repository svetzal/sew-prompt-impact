| Prompt Style | Code Complexity      | Type Hints & Pydantic Usage | Explanation Detail | Additional Libraries/Tools | Overall Tone / Structure |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Fancy        | More sophisticated: includes a class for tasks, a manager class, and multiple methods. | Yes, uses Pydantic and strict typing. | Detailed docstrings and explanations. | Pydantic (for validation), constants, etc. | Formal, structured, and follows advanced design principles. |
| Plain        | Simpler: a single Task class and a TaskManager class with basic functionality. | No Pydantic usage; no type hints in the code. | Short and direct explanations. | No extra dependencies beyond Python built-ins. | Straightforward, minimalistic, and less verbose. |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The "fancy" prompt style produces a more feature-rich solution that adheres more closely to advanced coding standards. It includes Pydantic for data validation, type annotations on every function, and thorough inline documentation.  
   • The "plain" prompt style yields a simpler code snippet that is easier to read and understand at a glance but omits strong type hints, validation, and advanced best practices.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Use of libraries and standards: The “fancy” output brings in Pydantic, type hints, docstrings in Google format, and constants (like MAX_TASKS). The “plain” output relies on only built-in Python features.  
   • Code structure and verbosity: The “fancy” version is more verbose in explanations, while the “plain” version uses concise docstrings or print statements to indicate actions.  
   • Level of detail in documentation: The “fancy” output consistently provides docstrings for each method, describing arguments and return values. The “plain” one keeps it simpler through inline `print` statements and does not systematically document function parameters.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Both versions implement a “Task” class and a “TaskManager” class.  
   • In both outputs, the basic workflow is similar: you can add tasks, mark them as completed or not, list them, and remove them.  
   • Each output example code demonstrates usage with a simple “main” routine, printing out added tasks and showing their statuses.
