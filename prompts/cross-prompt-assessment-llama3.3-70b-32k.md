## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Prompt Style | Output Complexity | Validation (e.g., pydantic) | Testing Provided | Code Structure | Additional Explanations |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| fancy       | High - includes pydantic, docstrings, type hints | Yes (pydantic)    | Yes (unittest)  | Class-based (Task & TaskManager), plus thorough docstrings and a main check | Extensive (includes usage notes, docstrings, requirements, commit message) |
| plain       | Medium - straightforward OOP with basic docstrings | No                | No (though code can be tested) | Single file with Task/TaskManager, simpler approach | Balanced clarity, fewer details; includes an interactive example usage loop |
| partial     | Medium - includes docstrings, simpler structure | No                | Yes (unittest)  | Class-based (Task & TaskManager), test suite included | Minimal but clear explanation, example usage block at the bottom |

## Qualitative Analysis

1) Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The “fancy” prompt generally yields the most extensive and polished output. It incorporates modern Python practices like type hints, pydantic-based data validation, style/linting references, and comprehensive docstrings. It also explicitly demonstrates how to test with unit tests, and it references best practices such as using “flake8” and “black.”  
   • This makes the “fancy” output well-suited for a production environment or a scenario where code quality, clarity, and maintainability are paramount.

2) What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Validation and Type Hints: The “fancy” style uses pydantic models and strict type hints, ensuring data validation. The “plain” and “partial” outputs skip pydantic validation or have fewer type hints.  
   • Testing Approach: The “fancy” and “partial” prompts both provide a separate unit test file, whereas the “plain” style demonstrates testing in an interactive loop rather than formal tests.  
   • Documentation and Explanation: The “fancy” style includes explanatory sections on installation, usage, and best practices. The “partial” style is relatively concise but still offers a test file. The “plain” style’s explanation is mostly embedded in docstrings and inline comments.

3) What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • All use an OOP approach with distinct classes to represent tasks and a manager to store or manipulate them (Task and TaskManager).  
   • All provide CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete).  
   • Each includes at least a brief example of how to instantiate and interact with the task manager.  
   • All mention or demonstrate some approach to testing or validation, even if it varies in detail.
