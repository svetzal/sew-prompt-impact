## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The “medium” style arguably offers the most balanced deliverable. It has straightforward code, a clear unit test suite demonstrating testability, and well-organized classes—all while avoiding heavy dependencies.  
   • The “fancy” style might be best when you need strong data validation (Pydantic) and advanced Python features, but it can be more than you need for a basic task manager.  
   • The “plain” style is the easiest to follow and spin up quickly, especially for novice users who just want to run an interactive script and don’t need formal testing or advanced type validation.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Advanced Features vs. Simplicity: The “fancy” style relies on Pydantic (for data models) and a dataclass for TaskManager. The “medium” style adds formal unittests and stays with basic classes but is fairly minimal in external dependencies. The “plain” style goes for immediate usability with a console-based interface and no tests or data validation.  
   • Testing Approach: The “medium” output includes a thorough unittest suite. The “fancy” output does not explicitly include tests (though it references correctness), and the “plain” output includes only an inline demonstration.  
   • Dependency Footprint: “fancy” uses Pydantic and requires additional packages. “medium” and “plain” rely primarily on standard library constructs.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Basic CRUD Operations: All three versions allow you to create, read, update, and delete tasks in some fashion.  
   • Clear Separation of Task Representation and Manager: All solutions define a Task entity (with some attributes) and a managing class (or set of methods) for operating on those tasks.  
   • Code Readability and Comments: Each variant includes docstrings or comments explaining usage, though at varying levels of detail.
