|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code Structure             | Uses Pydantic's BaseModel with UUIDs for task IDs.              | Uses a standard Python class with an integer ID counter.       |
| Validation & Type Hints    | Leverages Pydantic for validation and type hints.                | Provides docstrings but minimal or no explicit type hints.      |
| Output Formatting          | Includes a structured docstring, guidance on installation, usage, and tests in detail. | Includes inline docstrings and references usage in the code comments. |
| Readability & Maintainability | Focuses on clarity, intent revealing, and example test usage.    | Straightforward implementation with less explicit validation.   |
| Additional Features        | Demonstrates end-to-end usage (tests, main function example).     | Provides a direct script with an example usage section at the bottom.|
| Suitability                | Ideal for production or larger-scale codebases needing validation. | Sufficient for smaller scripts or quick prototypes.            |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The “fancy” style generally provides a more robust and production-friendly design. By leveraging Pydantic’s validation and UUID-based task identifiers, it follows a more modern Python approach, supports stricter type checking, and includes ready-to-run test cases. It also features thorough documentation with installation steps and usage examples.  
   • The “plain” style is simpler and faster to read if all you need is a lightweight, local script. It doesn’t require extra libraries (apart from the standard library) and may be more approachable for beginners.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Use of Pydantic vs. a standard Python class: “fancy” uses Pydantic’s BaseModel for validation, while “plain” manages tasks with basic classes.  
   • ID generation: “fancy” uses autogenerated UUIDs; “plain” uses an incrementing integer counter.  
   • Documentation and extra detail: “fancy” provides an installation guide, usage instructions, testing examples, and docstrings using Google style. “plain” provides simpler docstrings and a more concise usage flow.  
   • Testing: “fancy” includes a separate test module (unittest-based), whereas “plain” just provides an example usage section.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Both responses include complete working Python modules for task management that demonstrate create, read, update, and delete operations.  
   • In both, tasks are stored in an internal list.  
   • Each output shows an example usage pattern, illustrating how to create tasks and manipulate them.  
   • Both demonstrate docstrings and some form of descriptive commentary, although at different levels of thoroughness.
