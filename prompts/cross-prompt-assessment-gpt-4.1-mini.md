## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The “Fancy” style arguably yields the most robust and maintainable design due to Pydantic’s validation and comprehensive type hints. It facilitates clarity, enforceable constraints (for example, required fields, ID must be ≥ 1), and easy future extension.  
   • However, “best” may vary based on context. If you need minimal dependencies or a purely functional style, “Partial” or “Plain” might be preferable.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Data Model:  
     – “Fancy” uses Pydantic’s BaseModel.  
     – “Plain” defines a custom Task class manually.  
     – “Partial” uses dictionary-based task representations with pure functions.  
   • Validation & Type Hints:  
     – “Fancy” includes strict type checks using Pydantic and thorough type annotations.  
     – “Plain” offers some basic typing via the standard library’s typing imports but relies on a custom Task class with fewer constraints.  
     – “Partial” has typed function signatures but uses unvalidated dictionaries.  
   • Code Structure:  
     – “Fancy” and “Plain” are object-oriented, while “Partial” is purely functional.  
   • Docstrings & Documentation:  
     – “Fancy” uses relatively verbose docstrings (Google style) and thorough descriptions.  
     – “Plain” includes docstrings, but less formal and with fewer details compared to “Fancy.”  
     – “Partial” also uses docstrings but is very function-focused rather than class-based.  

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Fundamental Task Management Operations: All three solutions provide ways to add, remove, list, and update tasks, meeting the core requirement.  
   • Adequate Use of Python Standard Library: Each solution uses typing imports (List, Optional, etc.) and straightforward Python patterns to manipulate tasks.  
   • Readability & Clarity: Despite different implementations, each style is relatively readable and follows the goal of “code as communication,” delivering well-documented, maintainable task management functionality.
