## 1. Super-Condensed Comparison Table

| Prompt Style | Code Complexity     | Use of Type Hints & Docstrings | Design & Patterns          | Strengths                                                                 | Weaknesses                                                          |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **fancy**    | High (Pydantic, multiple methods, docstrings, etc.) | 100% coverage with docstrings, uses Pydantic BaseModel                   | Emphasizes robust architecture, validation, testing, ID tracking, docstrings | Thorough, production-ready approach with clear validations           | Heavier codebase, more boilerplate                                   |
| **medium**   | Medium (simple class, standard library)             | Minimal type hints (mostly for collections), docstrings are concise      | Straightforward, single class approach, purely in-memory                 | Balanced detail vs. complexity; easy to extend and read              | Less formal validation, does not leverage external libraries         |
| **plain**    | Low (single file, minimal structures)               | Some type annotations in certain methods only, docstrings are short      | Very simple, direct approach                                             | Quick to implement and understand; minimal dependencies              | Fewer safeguards (no robust validation), less structured             |

## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### 1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

• The “fancy” prompt style provides the most thorough, production-ready design. It enforces data validation using Pydantic, includes docstrings and type hints throughout, and demonstrates clear, extensible architecture (e.g., a separate `Task` model class with validation rules). For a full-scale application needing better data integrity, it’s the strongest.

• The “medium” prompt style offers a stronger balance between comprehensiveness and simplicity. It’s simpler than the fancy style but retains modular design practices (like docstrings, typed member variables) without third-party dependencies.

• The “plain” prompt style is the most straightforward for someone who just needs quick functionality. The result is easy to grasp but lacks the advanced protections and clarity found in the other two styles.

Overall, if code correctness, maintainability, and validation are top priorities, the “fancy” style yields the most robust solution. If minimal friction is the goal, the “plain” style might suffice. “Medium” sits comfortably in between.

### 2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

• Use of Third-Party Libraries:  
  – “fancy” leverages Pydantic for validation.  
  – “medium” and “plain” use only built-in Python features.

• Depth of Validation and Type Hints:  
  – “fancy” uses comprehensive type hints and docstrings.  
  – “medium” has simpler type hints.  
  – “plain” includes only baseline annotations, especially for return types and lists.

• Code Complexity and Structure:  
  – “fancy” has multiple methods for tasks (add, get, remove, mark done, filter by status), plus a robust “Task” model.  
  – “medium” covers a set of core operations (add, remove, list, check) with a single class.  
  – “plain” remains minimal, focusing on basic add/remove/list/mark operations.

• Presentation Tone and Explanation:  
  – “fancy” is accompanied by explanatory docstrings and presentation of engineering principles.  
  – “medium” has a lighter docstring approach, focusing on essential clarity.  
  – “plain” is almost purely functional, with short commentary.

### 3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

• Core Functionality: All three styles manage tasks with methods to add, remove, list, and mark tasks as done or verify their existence.  
• Readable, Self-Contained Modules: Each style wraps the functionality in a coherent class or set of classes, making it straightforward to integrate into a larger project.  
• Pythonic Syntax and Approach: All three are recognizably Pythonic, using standard constructs like lists to store tasks, `__init__` methods for setup, and clear function/method definitions.
