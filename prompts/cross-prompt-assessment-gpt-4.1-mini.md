## Extended Qualitative Analysis

1. **Which prompt style gives the best results overall?**  
   The "fancy" style provides a more robust code base, including Pydantic validation, complete type annotations, and adherence to advanced design principles. If you need correctness guarantees, clearer error handling, and strong type safety, the “fancy” prompt’s output excels. However, the “plain” style might be simpler to adopt for quick prototypes or smaller scripts.

2. **What aspects of the model’s response differ between the different prompt styles?**  
   - **Type Handling**: The “fancy” output uses type hints extensively and leverages Pydantic’s validation, while the “plain” output provides no explicit type hints and relies on Python’s dynamic nature.  
   - **Design Complexity**: The “fancy” version separates the Task and TaskManager logic more rigorously, showcasing advanced patterns like copying immutable data in place. In contrast, the “plain” code modifies objects in place with straightforward OOP.  
   - **Error Handling & Validation**: The “fancy” solution proactively handles validation (e.g., min_length in the `description` Field) and raises typed exceptions. The “plain” version does simpler index checks and lacks built-in data validation.

3. **What aspects of the model’s response are consistent across all prompt styles?**  
   - **Core Functionality**: Both solutions provide task creation, listing, marking completion, and deletion.  
   - **Class-based Approach**: They both have a `Task` entity and a manager or aggregator class to handle tasks.  
   - **Readability**: Despite different levels of sophistication, both retain overall clarity and logically structured methods for task operations.
