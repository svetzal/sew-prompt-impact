## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The “fancy” style stands out for its thoroughness regarding type hints and validation, thanks to Pydantic. It provides detailed docstrings, adheres to a professional-level coding style, and includes structured data models.  
   • On the other hand, the “partial” style excels in demonstrating test-driven development by providing a separate test suite. This is valuable for production-quality code, where tests serve as the executable specification.  
   • “Plain” is the simplest and most approachable but omits type hints and formal testing.  

   Overall, the “fancy” style is arguably the strongest in terms of production-ready code with full typing and robust structure, but the “partial” style’s explicit testing approach is also a major advantage.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Use of Type Hints and Validation:  
     – “fancy” employs Pydantic with strict typing.  
     – “plain” omits type hints and relies on ad hoc print statements.  
     – “partial” uses Python’s dataclasses and partial type annotations.  
   • Testing:  
     – “fancy” omits explicit tests in the snippet.  
     – “plain” includes only inline demonstration code, not actual tests.  
     – “partial” has a comprehensive unittest suite.  
   • Code Complexity:  
     – “fancy” is more sophisticated (Pydantic, full docstrings).  
     – “plain” is the most minimal.  
     – “partial” is in-between, balancing readability and TDD.  

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • All three outputs provide a Task or similar data container alongside operations to add, remove, and modify tasks.  
   • Each manages an internal list or collection of tasks with methods reflecting CRUD-like functionality.  
   • All solutions demonstrate an overall concern for clarity, though they differ in their adherence to advanced Python features and testing patterns.
