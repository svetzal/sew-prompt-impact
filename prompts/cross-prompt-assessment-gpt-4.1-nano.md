## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The “fancy” prompt style generally yields a more robust and maintainable code solution. It includes type hints, docstrings, and validation with pydantic, making it suitable for larger or more formal projects.  
   • The “plain” style is simpler and more lightweight, which can be advantageous for smaller scripts or quick prototypes.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • The “fancy” style enforces a stricter coding guideline, employing type hints (`List[Task]`), using pydantic for validation, and providing detailed docstrings.  
   • The “plain” style omits docstrings, type hints, and external dependencies, focusing on straightforward classes and methods without extra validation or documentation.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Both solutions correctly manage a list of tasks, allowing for task creation, removal, listing, and status updates.  
   • Each provides an object-oriented approach (a `Task` class and a `TaskManager` class).  
   • Both responses demonstrate basic clarity of intent and show standard Python usage for user interactions (like `add_task()`, `remove_task()`, etc.).
