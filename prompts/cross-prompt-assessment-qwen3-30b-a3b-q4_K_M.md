| Technology Stack   | Uses Pydantic, `uuid`, advanced docstrings, and typed fields                                         | Simple classes with docstrings, Python OOP features                              | Single-class approach, optional JSON persistence                                |
| Code Complexity    | Higher complexity (e.g., `TaskManager` plus `Task` model, type validations)                          | Moderate complexity (object model, basic filtering, simpler type usage)          | Lower complexity (bare dictionaries, minimal structure)                         |
| Feature Richness   | CRUD operations, filtering by “done/pending,” typed model, creation timestamp, ID generation         | CRUD operations, filtering by “completed/active,” incremental ID generation      | CRUD operations, JSON save/load, minimal filtering (complete vs. incomplete)    |
| Documentation      | Very detailed Google-style docstrings, highlights usage of each method, encloses code in docstrings  | Clear docstrings for key methods, demonstrates usage, includes an example in `__main__` block | Minimal docstrings, primarily direct explanation and an example usage snippet   |
| Advanced Patterns  | Emphasizes domain modeling (with `Task`), enumerates design principles, uses typed fields extensively | Plain OOP approach, avoids external dependencies beyond built-ins                | Single class with a minimal dictionary-based approach, uses built-in JSON only  |
| Strengths          | Highly structured, easy to extend, robust for larger projects, strict type checks                    | Balanced simplicity vs. clarity, easy to unit-test and integrate                 | Very straightforward, minimal overhead, literate examples, easy to get started  |
| Weaknesses         | Potential overkill for simple tasks, needs extra libs (pydantic)                                     | Might require manual enhancements if project grows (e.g., typed fields)          | Lacks robust validations, no type hints, less formal structure                  |

## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### 2.1 Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
• The “fancy” prompt style generally produces the richest solution. It uses Pydantic for validation, includes robust type hints, and provides a structured data model with detailed docstrings. This approach is more extensible and maintainable for professional or long-term projects, especially where correctness and clarity are paramount.

### 2.2 What aspects of the model’s response differ between the different prompt styles?
• The “fancy” output relies on more advanced Python features (like Pydantic models, UUIDs, typed fields), giving it a heavier but more powerful construction.  
• The “medium” output is “classic” Python OOP: a custom Task class, a TaskManager, moderate docstrings, but no advanced libraries or strict typing.  
• The “plain” output is minimal, relying mostly on push/pop from a list of dictionaries, and handling persistence through JSON. It offers fewer advanced features (no typed fields, no built-in ID generation, no time stamps).

### 2.3 What aspects of the model’s response are consistent across all prompt styles?
• All outputs implement core CRUD functionality (creation, listing, updating/completing, and deletion).  
• Each version provides an easy-to-follow code structure that can be tested or extended.  
• They all include at least some level of docstring or comments explaining usage.  
• In all three, the fundamental concept—managing tasks in memory, referencing tasks through some form of ID or index—remains the same.
