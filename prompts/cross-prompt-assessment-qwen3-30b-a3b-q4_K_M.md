| **Fancy**    | Higher          | Yes                            | “Functional Core, Imperative Shell”; uses Pydantic models and Enums | Yes                     | Strong typing, clear structure, better for larger projects | Might be overkill for small, quick scripts            |

### Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   The "fancy" prompt style generally provides a more robust and production-ready solution. It showcases advanced Python features (Pydantic, Enums, type hints), which facilitate validation, maintainability, and clarity. It aligns well with modern software engineering practices and ensures strong type safety.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   - ■ Use of Type System:  
     The "fancy" version leverages Pydantic for data validation and Enums for task status, while the "plain" version relies on a simpler class design without explicit type hints or validations.  
   - ■ Complexity and Architecture:  
     The "fancy" solution adheres more closely to a “clean architecture” approach, incorporating separation of concerns, whereas the "plain" approach uses a more direct object-oriented method with minimal tooling.  
   - ■ Feature Depth:  
     The "fancy" solution includes status management (pending, in-progress, completed), automatically generated UUID IDs, and timestamp management, whereas the "plain" approach only includes rudimentary attributes (description, priority, completion state).  

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   - ■ Basic Task Management:  
     Both the "fancy" and "plain" outputs support core CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.  
   - ■ Example Usage:  
     In each version, a simple usage snippet is provided, ensuring that a developer can quickly understand how to integrate the module.  
   - ■ Logical Organization:  
     Both solutions define a main class to manage the tasks (TaskManager) and a task entity (Task). Each solution is self-contained and designed for direct inclusion in a Python codebase.
