## Detailed Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
   • The “fancy” prompt style produces the most thorough and industry-aligned Python module. It leverages Pydantic for validation, uses enums to manage state, and follows a well-documented structure that exhibits compliance with the enumerated engineering principles. 
   • If you want strict type safety, extensive docstrings, and advanced design patterns (like the separation into “functional core” and “imperative shell”), the “fancy” style output appears best.

2. What aspects of the model’s response differ between the different prompt styles?
   • “Fancy” places heavy emphasis on typed structures (Enums, Pydantic models) and thorough docstrings aligned with best practices. Additionally, it provides robust error handling.  
   • “Plain” is more direct, compact, and slightly simpler to follow, with additional features like sorting by priority or due date, but less formal enforcement of types.  
   • “Partial” is the leanest, using only a dataclass for the Task model and a straightforward CRUD approach with minimal code overhead or type checking.

3. What aspects of the model’s response are consistent across all prompt styles?
   • All three approaches implement the core functionalities of task management: creation/adding, listing, updating, and removing tasks.  
   • Each version includes a straightforward Task class and a TaskManager (or equivalent) to handle the list of tasks.  
   • Basic error handling is present in all versions (though the sophistication of validation differs), and the code in each uses Pythonic idioms for iteration and management of tasks.

Overall, each style achieves the goal of providing a Python task management module, but the “fancy” style stands out for its advanced type checking, structured approach, and alignment with the defined coding and design principles.
