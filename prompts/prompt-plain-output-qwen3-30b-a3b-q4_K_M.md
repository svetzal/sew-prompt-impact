### ðŸ§© Example Usage

```python
from task_manager import TaskManager

# Create a task manager
tm = TaskManager()

# Add tasks
tm.add_task("Buy groceries", 2)
tm.add_task("Walk the dog", 1)
tm.add_task("Finish project", 3)

# Print all tasks
print("All Tasks:")
print(tm)

# Mark a task as complete
tm.update_task(0, completed=True)

# Get and print only completed tasks
print("\nCompleted Tasks:")
print(tm.get_tasks(completed=True))

# Remove a task by index
tm.remove_task(1)

# Print the updated list
print("\nAfter Removal:")
print(tm)
```

This module provides a clean, object-oriented way to manage a collection of tasks with support for prioritization, completion status tracking, and filtering. Itâ€™s easy to extend or integrate into larger applications.
