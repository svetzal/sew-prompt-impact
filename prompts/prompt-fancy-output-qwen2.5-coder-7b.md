Certainly! Below is a Python module designed to manage a list of tasks. This module includes functionalities to add, remove, and list tasks, along with validation and proper documentation. The code follows the principles outlined in the Baseline Conventions, focusing on simplicity, readability, and testability.

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Task(BaseModel):
    id: int
    description: str
    completed: bool = False

    class Config:
        allow_mutation = False

class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._tasks: List[Task] = []
        self._next_id: int = 1

    @property
    def tasks(self) -> List[Task]:
        return self._tasks.copy()

    def add_task(self, description: str) -> None:
        """
        Adds a new task to the list with the given description.
        """
        if not description.strip():
            raise ValueError("Task description cannot be empty")

        new_task = Task(id=self._next_id, description=description)
        self._tasks.append(new_task)
        self._next_id += 1

    def remove_task(self, task_id: int) -> None:
        """
        Removes the task with the given ID from the list.
        Raises ValueError if no such task exists.
        """
        for i, task in enumerate(self._tasks):
            if task.id == task_id:
                del self._tasks[i]
                return
        raise ValueError(f"Task with ID {task_id} not found")

    def complete_task(self, task_id: int) -> None:
        """
        Marks the task with the given ID as completed.
        Raises ValueError if no such task exists or it is already completed.
        """
        for task in self._tasks:
            if task.id == task_id and not task.completed:
                task.completed = True
                return
        raise ValueError(f"Task with ID {task_id} not found or already completed")

    def incomplete_task(self, task_id: int) -> None:
        """
        Marks the task with the given ID as incomplete.
        Raises ValueError if no such task exists or it is already incomplete.
        """
        for task in self._tasks:
            if task.id == task_id and task.completed:
                task.completed = False
                return
        raise ValueError(f"Task with ID {task_id} not found or already incomplete")

    def get_task(self, task_id: int) -> Optional[Task]:
        """
        Returns the task with the given ID, or None if it does not exist.
        """
        for task in self._tasks:
            if task.id == task_id:
                return task
        return None

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    manager = TaskManager()
    manager.add_task("Buy groceries")
    manager.add_task("Clean the house")
    
    print(manager.tasks)
    
    try:
        manager.complete_task(1)
        print(manager.tasks)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

    try:
        manager.remove_task(2)
        print(manager.tasks)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
```

### Key Points:

1. **Task Class**: Uses `pydantic.BaseModel` to ensure data validation and immutability.
2. **TaskManager Class**: Manages the list of tasks, providing methods to add, remove, complete, and get tasks.
3. **Type Hints & Docstrings**: Follows the guidelines for type hints and docstring formatting.
4. **Testing**: This example includes basic usage at the bottom for demonstration purposes. For a full-fledged module, you would include unit tests to ensure all functionalities work as expected.

This module adheres to the principles of simplicity, readability, and robustness, making it easy to understand and maintain.
