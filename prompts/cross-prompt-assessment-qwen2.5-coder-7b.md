|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **fancy**    | Provides a full project structure, multiple files, and test examples. Very detailed. | • Highly detailed, follows best practices thoroughly. <br> • Includes testing, directory structure, and usage instructions. | • More complex setup and boilerplate might be overkill for small-scale tasks. <br> • Requires familiarity with multiple files and testing frameworks. |
| **medium**   | Single-file approach with a separate `Task` class, moderate complexity. | • Balanced detail: includes data model, manager, and usage examples. <br> • Easier to read and maintain than “plain” version. | • Less comprehensive than “fancy.” <br> • Lacks formal test modules and directory structure. |
| **plain**    | Minimal single-file script with straightforward methods. | • Very simple, easy to understand for beginners. <br> • Quick to implement. | • Less scalable for bigger projects. <br> • Lacks robust testing, separation of concerns, or structured project layout. |

## Qualitative Analysis

### 1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
The **fancy** prompt style provides the most thorough and production-ready result. It includes:  
• A clear directory structure (e.g., `tasks.py`, `models.py`, `tests/`),  
• Comprehensive usage instructions,  
• Testing with `pytest`,  
• Type hints via Pydantic,  
• Setup script for packaging.  

This makes the “fancy” output significantly more complete for professional use. If you need a robust and well-tested codebase, “fancy” is best.

### 2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?
• **Level of Detail** — “fancy” provides a multi-file structure, testing framework, and thorough installation guide. “medium” uses a single file yet retains some structure. “plain” is the simplest and minimal.  
• **Project Organization** — “fancy” organizes code into multiple files and uses an OOP approach plus usage of third-party modules (Pydantic). “medium” also uses an OOP approach but is monolithic. “plain” is a single class in a single file, with no external dependencies.  
• **Testing** — “fancy” includes separate test modules, “medium” includes no formal testing structure, and “plain” has no tests aside from inline demonstration.  
• **Dependency Management** — “fancy” references `flake8`, `black`, and `mypy` plus Pydantic and `pytest`. The other styles omit such robust tooling.

### 3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?
• **Core Goal** — All three outputs manage task data.  
• **Fundamental Actions** — Each includes methods/functions to add, remove, and update tasks in some form.  
• **Object-Oriented Approach** — Each style encapsulates tasks or task management within either a class or multiple classes.  
• **Demonstration** — All include at least a small code snippet or usage example of how to interact with the system.

Overall, the shared functionality is the ability to create, store, and update tasks, but each style differs in granularity and the complexity of its architecture.
