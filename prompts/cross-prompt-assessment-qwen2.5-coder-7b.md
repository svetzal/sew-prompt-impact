| Comparison Aspect              | Fancy Prompt Output                                                          | Plain Prompt Output                                                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code Complexity               | More advanced structure (uses Pydantic, typed functions).                    | Simple class-based approach without additional libraries.                 |
| Features Implemented          | Add, update, remove, list tasks with Pydantic-based validation.              | Add, remove, list tasks using basic Python data structures.               |
| Use of External Libraries     | Uses Pydantic for validation and UUID generation.                            | Uses no external libraries.                                               |
| Testing and Documentation     | Includes pytest-based test examples and docstrings following Google style.   | No explicit test examples, minimal docstrings.                            |
| Suitability for Larger Apps   | More scalable with typed models, validation, and test suite hints.           | Straightforward but better for smaller or quick scripting use-cases.      |
| Adherence to Style Guidelines | Conforms strictly to the outlined best practices (linting, typed hints).     | Minimal references to style best practices or advanced coding standards.  |
| Overall Code Readability      | Very explicit, more lines, but reveals intent through typed constructs.      | Shorter, straightforward, direct approach.                                |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?  
   • The “fancy” prompt style arguably yields a more robust solution. It includes advanced features like model validation (via Pydantic), UUID-based IDs, type hints covering all functions, and even an example test suite using pytest. This makes it a strong fit for scalable or production-level needs.  

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?  
   • The “fancy” prompt response demonstrates more thorough adherence to comprehensive coding standards, including docstrings, linting, testing, and type-coverage practices. It also shows awareness of advanced concepts such as validators in data models.  
   • The “plain” prompt output is notably simpler, focusing on a single class that maintains a list of tasks without external dependencies. It offers a straightforward CLI example, but omits advanced validation, testing, or type hinting.  

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?  
   • Both outputs address the fundamental requirement: managing tasks (adding, removing, and listing).  
   • Both solutions rely on Pythonic patterns for basic list manipulation.  
   • Both provide illustrative main-guard examples showing how to use their functionality, though at different levels of complexity.
