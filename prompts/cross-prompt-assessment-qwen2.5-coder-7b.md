## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The "fancy" style tends to produce the most thorough, robust, and “production-ready” code. It leverages advanced Python features like pydantic models for validation and immutability, verbose docstrings, and type hints. If your priority is correctness, maintainability, and clarity for complex scenarios, the "fancy" style is likely the best. However, its level of complexity might be more than needed for a simple use case.  
   • The "plain" style is the most minimal and easiest to follow, but it lacks formal validations, type hints, and test structures used in the other styles.  
   • The "partial" style strikes a middle ground between the extremes, offering a structured but simpler approach, along with dedicated tests and clean organization.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Validation and Immutability:  
     – The "fancy" prompt includes pydantic validations and immutability constraints, while the other two omit advanced validations.  
   • Complexity and Dependencies:  
     – The "plain" prompt uses minimal dependencies, whereas the "fancy" one adds pydantic.  
   • Testing Approach:  
     – The "partial" style explicitly includes a separate test file with unittest, showing a commitment to testing directly. The "fancy" includes inline usage examples, whereas the "plain" style only includes a short illustrative usage section in the same file.  
   • Code Structure:  
     – The "fancy" style has a well-delineated Task model and TaskManager class with thorough methods.  
     – The "partial" style similarly splits the logic into separate classes but also adds a folder structure and more detail for the testing environment.  
     – The "plain" style focuses on a single class with quick, direct methods.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Core Functionality:  
     – All three outputs allow you to add tasks, remove tasks, and list tasks.  
   • Readability:  
     – Although at different levels of detail, each style keeps the code straightforward and relatively easy to follow for someone familiar with Python.  
   • Alignment to the Goal:  
     – Each prompt satisfies the fundamental requirement of “managing a list of tasks” through a Python module or class.  
   • Overall Adherence to Conventions:  
     – While some (like "fancy") explicitly mention advanced style guidelines (e.g., docstrings, type hints), all solutions observe basic coding conventions such as meaningful method names and generally short, readable methods.
