Below is an assessment of each file’s output (cited by filename) in terms of how it addresses the prompt “Make me a python module that can manage a list of tasks.” This comparison focuses on core features, code organization, and overall clarity or completeness.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) FILE: prompts/plain-output-qwen3-32b.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Scope and Features:  
  - Provides a rich feature set: task creation, description and priority updates, marking tasks as complete, filtering by status, etc.  
  - Includes error handling (e.g., ValueError when description is empty).
  - Allows filtering tasks by status (pending/completed).  
  - Uses a dictionary keyed by task_id for efficient lookup.

• Code Organization:  
  - Split into two classes (Task and TaskManager).  
  - Task class encapsulates single-task logic like marking complete.  
  - TaskManager handles higher-level functions (CRUD operations).

• Notable Strengths / Uniqueness:  
  - Comprehensive approach with next_id to generate unique IDs.  
  - Clear docstrings and usage examples.  
  - Good for ID-based reference rather than list indices.

• Complexity / Readability:  
  - More extensive than minimal: thorough API with multiple methods.  
  - Very clean structure and docstrings, user-friendly.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) FILE: prompts/plain-output-qwen3-30b.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Scope and Features:  
  - Provides additional support for saving/loading tasks from a JSON file.  
  - Emphasizes optional due dates, marking tasks as complete, listing tasks by completion status.  

• Code Organization:  
  - Two classes (Task and TaskManager), but the Task class is simpler (just a description, optional due date, completed status).  
  - TaskManager includes add, mark_as_complete, delete, list, and file I/O methods.  

• Notable Strengths / Uniqueness:  
  - Includes persistence via JSON, which is a nice feature for real-world usage.  
  - Includes date handling (with an attempt to parse YYYY-MM-DD).  

• Complexity / Readability:  
  - Slightly more advanced than a minimal version because it demonstrates JSON storage and date parsing.  
  - Well-commented and straightforward to read.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) FILE: prompts/plain-output-qwen3-30b-a3b-q4_K_M.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Scope and Features:  
  - Similar approach to qwen3-30b: tasks have a “description” and a “completed” flag, with optional JSON persistence.  
  - Minimal feature set (add, mark as done, remove, view, save/load).  

• Code Organization:  
  - Single class (TaskManager) that stores tasks in a list of dictionaries (rather than separate Task objects).  
  - Methods for adding, removing, marking as done, viewing tasks, saving, and loading.

• Notable Strengths / Uniqueness:  
  - Simple, direct structure. Good for smaller or straightforward codebases.  
  - JSON persistence is integrated, making it easy to save and load tasks.

• Complexity / Readability:  
  - Easy to follow. Minimal overhead.  
  - If someone needs more advanced features like priorities or statuses beyond “completed,” this code is easily extendable.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) FILE: prompts/plain-output-qwen2.5-32b.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Scope and Features:  
  - A minimal module with a single class (TaskManager) holding tasks in a list.  
  - Implements add, remove, and list functionality.  
  - Very straightforward example that lacks advanced functionality (like completion status or persistence).

• Code Organization:  
  - One class, no separation between Task objects and manager.  
  - Methods: add_task, remove_task, list_tasks.

• Notable Strengths / Uniqueness:  
  - Very concise and easy to understand. Good for a quick demonstration.

• Complexity / Readability:  
  - Extremely simple. Possibly too bare-bones if more sophisticated features are needed.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) FILE: prompts/plain-output-qwen2.5-coder-32b.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Scope and Features:  
  - Balanced approach: add tasks, remove tasks, update tasks by ID, list them.  
  - Tracks tasks in a list of dictionaries, each with ID and description.  

• Code Organization:  
  - Single class (TaskManager).  
  - Basic CRUD operations: add_task, remove_task, update_task, list_tasks.

• Notable Strengths / Uniqueness:  
  - Uses numeric IDs, similar to the first file but with a simpler approach.  
  - Straightforward example usage provided in the “if __name__ == ‘__main__’” block.

• Complexity / Readability:  
  - Clear enough. Less detailed error handling than some.  
  - Good for moderate usage without advanced features like file persistence or completion status.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) FILE: prompts/plain-output-qwen2.5-coder-7b.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Scope and Features:  
  - Provides a TaskManager class with more robust fields: task_name, optional due_date, optional description, plus a completion flag.  
  - Includes methods to add tasks, remove tasks, update tasks, mark tasks as completed, and list tasks.

• Code Organization:  
  - Tasks stored directly in a list of dictionaries rather than separate Task objects.  
  - Contains five main methods: add_task, remove_task, update_task, mark_task_as_completed, list_tasks.

• Notable Strengths / Uniqueness:  
  - Incorporates due_date and more descriptive fields out of the box.  
  - Example usage at the bottom clarifies how to run it.

• Complexity / Readability:  
  - Clear, well-structured, with docstrings.  
  - Good declarative approach showing how to expand beyond a simple “description” field.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) FILE: prompts/plain-output-qwen2.5-72b.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Scope and Features:  
  - Straightforward, single-class solution.  
  - Adds tasks (with description), marks completion by index, removes tasks by index, and lists them all.

• Code Organization:  
  - All logic in a single class, storing tasks in a list of dictionaries {‘description’, ‘completed’}.  
  - Minimal complexity: basically add, mark_completed, remove, list.

• Notable Strengths / Uniqueness:  
  - Very accessible for beginners.  
  - Clear use of return strings to provide immediate feedback in each method.

• Complexity / Readability:  
  - Extremely simple to read.  
  - Lacks advanced features (e.g., no saving, no priority).

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8) FILE: prompts/plain-output-llama3.3-70b-32k.md
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Scope and Features:  
  - Two classes: Task (with title, description, completed status) and TaskManager (managing multiple tasks).  
  - Allows adding tasks, viewing tasks, deleting tasks, updating task status.  
  - Includes a command-line interface in the main() function.

• Code Organization:  
  - Clear separation of concerns: Task class for the task structure, TaskManager for high-level commands.  
  - Demonstration of usage in a CLI style: add, view, delete, update status, etc.

• Notable Strengths / Uniqueness:  
  - Comprehensive example of a small interactive CLI.  
  - Clear printing format that shows tasks with their index and status.  

• Complexity / Readability:  
  - Moderately sized. The CLI loop is helpful for quick testing.  
  - Doesn’t include file I/O or advanced features like due dates, but is neatly laid out.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OVERALL COMPARISON
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Most Comprehensive Feature Set:  
  - prompts/plain-output-qwen3-32b.md stands out for robust ID-based tasks, advanced filtering, explicit error checks.  
  - prompts/plain-output-qwen3-30b.md adds JSON persistence, date handling—useful for a real-world scenario.

• Easiest to Understand / Minimalistic:  
  - prompts/plain-output-qwen2.5-32b.md, prompts/plain-output-qwen2.5-72b.md, and some others (qwen2.5-coder-32b) are smaller, minimal examples.  

• With Persistence and/or Extended Functionality:  
  - prompts/plain-output-qwen3-30b.md, prompts/plain-output-qwen3-30b-a3b-q4_K_M.md: both add JSON save/load.  
  - prompts/plain-output-qwen3-30b.md also demonstrates parsing a due date and error handling for invalid formats.

• CLI Interactivity:  
  - prompts/plain-output-llama3.3-70b-32k.md includes a main() loop that asks for input, which is good for learning or quick tests.

• Code Structure / Style:  
  - Several files separate the logic into classes (Task, TaskManager). Others store tasks in raw lists/dictionaries.  
  - The multi-class approach (Task + TaskManager) is more OOP-focused. The single-class approach is simpler but less modular.

• Error Handling and Validation:  
  - The first output (qwen3-32b) has robust checks for empty strings, etc.  
  - Some minimal versions rely on “try/except” for index range or simply do less validation.

In summary, each file addresses the “task manager” prompt but with varying emphasis on features such as persistence, CLI, OOP design, and data validation. Collectively, they show a broad range of implementations from simple single-class structures to more advanced multi-class systems with file I/O and CLI.
