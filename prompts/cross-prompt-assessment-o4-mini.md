| Characteristic                       | Fancy Prompt Style                           | Plain Prompt Style                                 |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Level of Detail                      | Very detailed instructions and constraints   | Simpler, more direct instructions                  |
| Code Structure & Conventions         | Uses pydantic models, type hints, tests      | Uses dataclass, fewer advanced Python features     |
| Testing & Validation                 | Includes robust test suite and TDD approach  | No formal tests provided, minimal validation       |
| Coding Style Guidance                | Strict style rules (black, flake8, mypy)     | Basic code structure, less emphasis on lint/type   |
| Additional Features                  | Demonstrates advanced principles (e.g., pure functions, incremental approach) | Offers optional CLI-based persistence to JSON   |
| Overall Complexity                   | High (multiple files, test modules)          | Moderate (single file with CLI usage)             |
| Strengths                            | Thorough specification, clear layering       | Quick to implement and easy to understand         |
| Weaknesses                           | More complex setup, may be overkill for simple tasks | Limited validation and testing                    |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
   - The “fancy” prompt style tends to produce a more comprehensive solution. It enforces type hints, testing, linting, and other best practices by design. This results in a cleaner, more maintainable solution that includes test coverage and meets strict style/quality guidelines. The “plain” prompt style produces a perfectly functional module but is less formal and omits many of the quality safeguards (tests, mypy, etc.) found in the “fancy” version.

2. What aspects of the model’s response differ between the different prompt styles?
   - The “fancy” output includes:
     • A detailed set of instructions on how to set up and run tests (pytest, mypy, flake8, black).  
     • Pydantic models for data validation.  
     • A separate test file illustrating unit tests.  
     • Clear layering of pure functions vs. an imperative shell.  

   - The “plain” output:  
     • Is a single-file solution.  
     • Uses dataclasses but lacks robust validation.  
     • Contains a basic CLI for interacting with tasks.  
     • Does not specify or enforce style, type checks, or comprehensive tests.  

3. What aspects of the model’s response are consistent across all prompt styles?
   - Both solutions meet the core requirement of creating, listing, updating, and deleting tasks.  
   - Both manage tasks in memory and allow marking tasks as complete.  
   - Both provide a straightforward, fairly readable Python implementation.  
   - In each response, the user ends up with a self-contained module that can be imported and used or run directly.
