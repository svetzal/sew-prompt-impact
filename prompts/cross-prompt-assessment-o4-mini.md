## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • The “fancy” prompt style provides the most robust solution for enterprise-level scenarios that need strong data validation, typed models, and detailed unit tests. It is more comprehensive and includes a dedicated test suite with pytest and strict type hints. However, it requires additional dependencies (pydantic) and sets a higher bar for environment setup.  
   • The “medium” prompt style excels at a concise, functional approach. It uses immutable data structures (frozen dataclasses) and pure functions, making it easy to test and reason about. It is a strong option for simpler use cases or where minimal dependencies are desired.  
   • The “plain” prompt style gives a more direct “batteries included” experience by offering a CLI interface and JSON persistence in a single file. For immediate usage without numerous dependencies or an external test framework, this is very convenient. However, it lacks some advanced type-checking and does not come with built-in unit tests.

   Overall, the best approach depends on context; if you need advanced validation and tests, “fancy” is strongest. If you want a purely functional approach with minimal magic, “medium” is best. If an immediate CLI and a straightforward save/load system is critical, “plain” wins.

2. What aspects of the model’s response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Use of dependencies: “fancy” requires pydantic and pytest, “medium” uses just standard library dataclasses and pytest, while “plain” is entirely standard library except for optional argparse.  
   • Code organization: “fancy” organizes tasks in classes with a significant test suite. “medium” keeps things purely functional. “plain” merges a “Task” class with a “TaskManager,” a CLI, and a JSON-based persistence layer.  
   • Testing approach: “fancy” uses a separate test file and a robust set of tests with pytest, “medium” also uses pytest but with fewer lines of code, and “plain” has only inline usage examples (no separate test suite).

3. What aspects of the model’s response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Each output fulfills basic CRUD operations over “tasks.”  
   • All three handle the concept of “completed” vs. “pending” tasks.  
   • They each show a clear separation of concerns: how tasks are created, listed, updated, and removed is consistent across styles.  
   • All three aim to be easy to integrate, whether by import in another Python script or by direct usage (although the “plain” prompt style goes further with a built-in CLI).
