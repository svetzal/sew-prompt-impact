| fancy       | Pure functional tasks module (+ pytest)    | Moderate  | Exceptions, fully pure logic   | Very clean separation of concerns; functional design; robust test coverage; thorough docstrings/results | Requires more advanced knowledge (pure functions, exceptions for not found); can be overly structured  |
| plain       | Class-based “TaskManager” storing tasks     | Simpler   | Optional JSON persistence       | Straightforward OOP design; simpler to extend and integrate; convenient “save/load” methods             | Less explicit testing approach (no separate test module in the snippet); can accumulate side effects   |
| partial     | Hybrid approach: OOP manager + immutable dataclass tasks | Moderate  | Minimal I/O (just logic + tests) | Good test coverage with pytest; emphasizes immutability for tasks; incremental approach with example tests | Fewer bells and whistles like persistence; relies on user to extend or add advanced features          |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   If “best” means faithful adherence to “functional core, imperative shell” (as outlined in the original Baseline Conventions), then the “fancy” prompt style arguably provides the most robust and principled design. It strictly isolates side-effects to the edges (e.g., timestamps, UUID generation), and all business logic is expressed in pure functions. On the other hand, if “best” means easiest to integrate into a typical application (with persistent storage, fewer separate functions), then the “plain” version might be more straightforward. The “partial” style strikes a balance, mixing immutability with a simple manager interface.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   - The “fancy” style: 
     • Takes a more functional programming approach, using pure functions to manipulate lists of tasks.  
     • Leans heavily on testing with detailed exception classes (e.g., TaskNotFoundError).  
     • Includes sophisticated docstrings and type hints, and uses pydantic for data validation in one example.

   - The “plain” style: 
     • Is purely object-oriented, with a TaskManager class that holds tasks in a list.  
     • Offers optional JSON persistence with “save_to_file” and “load_from_file.”  
     • Uses a simple @dataclass for Task, minimal error handling (returns None / booleans for certain methods).

   - The “partial” style: 
     • Combines an immutable data class for tasks with a manager class.  
     • Provides thorough pytest tests.  
     • Minimizes extra features (like persistence), focusing more on correctness and test coverage.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • All three approaches implement basic CRUD functionality for tasks (create, read, update, delete).  
   • They each demonstrate a focus on testability, whether with integrated tests (“plain”) or separate Pytest modules (“fancy” / “partial”).  
   • They follow Python best practices: type hints or data classes, relatively simple method signatures, and a separation of concern for distinct operations.  
   • They all are mindful of code readability, some code documentation, and clarity in function or method names.

In summary, each style has its own advantages, from the purely functional approach (“fancy”) to the simpler, more direct OOP approach (“plain”), to a hybrid emphasis on immutability (“partial”). Which one is “best” depends on the user’s specific needs and preferred design philosophy.
