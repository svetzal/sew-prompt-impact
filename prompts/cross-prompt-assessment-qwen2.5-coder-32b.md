**Tabular Comparison**

| Prompt Style | Code Complexity | Best-Practice Features | Testing Approach | Additional Libraries Used | Overall Explanation & Documentation |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Fancy**    | High            | • 100% type hints<br>• Pydantic models<br>• Google-style docstrings | Not included in the snippet (though it mentions tests) | pydantic (for data models) | Very detailed, with explanations for each part and reasons for choices |
| **Medium**   | Medium          | • Straightforward class<br>• No explicit type hints<br>• Clear docstrings | Uses built-in unittest for multiple test cases | No additional libraries beyond stdlib | Moderately detailed, includes separate test file and instructions |
| **Plain**    | Low             | • No type hints<br>• Very minimal docstrings | No tests included | No additional libraries | Concise, focusing primarily on core functionality only |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. **Which prompt style gives the best results overall?**

   - The **fancy** style provides the most comprehensive, production-oriented code with type hints, `pydantic` models, and detailed docstrings. This makes it the “best” in terms of thoroughness and alignment with sophisticated coding standards.
   - The **medium** style strikes a balance: it still offers helpful structure, includes unit tests, and remains relatively concise. It lacks type hints but provides a clearer testing approach than the fancy style snippet (which references tests but does not show them).
   - The **plain** style is the simplest, with minimal code and no tests or type hints. It is easy to read but does not strictly adhere to best practices.

2. **What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?**

   - **Complexity & Detail**: 
     - The fancy style is more elaborate, featuring `pydantic.BaseModel`, type hints, docstrings, and an example usage block.  
     - The medium style uses a simple class with docstrings and includes a separate test file with `unittest`.  
     - The plain style is the most concise, presenting only a few methods and sticking to simple print statements for feedback.

   - **Use of Libraries and Features**:  
     - Fancy uses `pydantic`, type hints, and advanced docstring formatting.  
     - Medium uses standard Python features only (unittest, no external libraries).  
     - Plain style uses nothing beyond basic Python constructs.

   - **Testing**:  
     - Fancy references the importance of tests but does not explicitly demonstrate them.  
     - Medium includes explicit, well-structured tests.  
     - Plain does not include tests.

3. **What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?**

   - All three styles produce a functional “task manager” with the core operations of adding, removing, and listing tasks (and in some cases, updating tasks).  
   - They each demonstrate clear, readable code within the scope of their complexity level.  
   - They address the user’s request to manage a list of tasks, though the implementation details and thoroughness vary.
