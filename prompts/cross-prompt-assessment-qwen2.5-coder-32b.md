## More Extensive Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?  
   • The "fancy" style yields a more robust and production-ready module. It enforces strong validation logic (via Pydantic), includes thorough type hints, follows strict linting and formatting standards, and documents the code meticulously. Hence, if "best" means most professional and ready for larger-scale projects, the "fancy" prompt’s result is superior.  
   • However, in simpler scenarios where minimal code is sufficient, the "plain" style might feel more accessible and direct.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?  
   • Code Complexity: The fancy style is more sophisticated, leverages Pydantic models, and includes validation checks; the plain style is more minimal.  
   • Documentation and Standards: The fancy style strongly highlights linting, type hints, and docstring formatting, while the plain style offers simpler docstrings and no explicit linting guidelines.  
   • Structural Design: The fancy style references design heuristics (like "functional core, imperative shell") and includes more functionalities (e.g., generating new IDs, marking tasks as completed). The plain style focuses on straightforward list manipulation.  
   • Dependencies: The fancy style employs Pydantic for data validation, while the plain style avoids additional libraries.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?  
   • Core Functionality: Both styles include the central functionality to add, remove, update, and list tasks.  
   • Readability: Despite differences, each example is comprehensible and uses sensible naming for classes and methods.  
   • Clarity of Usage: Both outputs demonstrate usage examples, albeit with varying detail and complexity, showing how to interact with the class.
