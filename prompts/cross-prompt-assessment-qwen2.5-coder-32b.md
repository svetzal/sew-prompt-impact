| Prompt Style | Key Differences                                                     | Strengths                                                                             | Weaknesses                                                                                         |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fancy        | Utilizes Pydantic, docstrings, type hints, and detailed tests.   | Highly robust: includes validation, strict typing, docstrings, thorough tests.        | Can be overkill for simple use-cases. Requires extra dependencies (e.g., pydantic).                  |
| plain        | Minimalist approach with just a Task and TaskManager classes.     | Simple, easy to read, low overhead.                                                  | Lacks type hints, detailed tests, or complex validation.                                             |
| partial      | Mid-level, includes a test function, but lacks Pydantic or hints. | Has basic tests, straightforward classes, less overhead than the “fancy” approach.    | Missing advanced validations (type hints, Pydantic), less comprehensive than the fancy version.      |

1) Which prompt style gives the best results overall?  
   • The "fancy" prompt style generally provides the most comprehensive and production-ready solution. It includes type hints (passing mypy checks), uses Pydantic for validation, and covers functionality with clear unit tests. While it might be overkill for some simpler tasks, from a software engineering standpoint, it delivers a robust, maintainable, and well-documented final product.

2) What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?  
   • The "fancy" prompt output includes advanced features: strict typing, Pydantic validation, detailed docstrings, and unit tests that thoroughly test functionality.  
   • The "plain" prompt output is a straightforward, minimalistic script with neither type checks nor comprehensive tests. It is the most bare-bones solution among the three.  
   • The "partial" prompt output strikes a balance: it provides a test function and some basic class designs but lacks the completeness of the "fancy" version (omitting Pydantic, type hints, and more formal docstrings).

3) What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?  
   • All three responses include a Task-like object or class and a managing class (TaskManager) with methods to add, update, and remove tasks.  
   • Each solution can handle basic task workflows (create tasks, mark them completed or remove them, and list them).  
   • All solutions demonstrate a clear separation of concerns: a Task or data class to represent individual tasks, and a TaskManager to control collections of tasks.
