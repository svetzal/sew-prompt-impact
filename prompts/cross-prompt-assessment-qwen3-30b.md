| fancy       | Pydantic-based Task model with timestamps  | Moderate                 | Strong (pydantic & mypy)            | datetime, pydantic | Provides robust data model, built-in validation, uses auto-generated timestamps, thorough docstrings and typed class fields.    | Requires extra library (pydantic), slightly more verbose, may be overkill for simpler use cases.                                |
| plain       | Simple Python class with dict-based tasks  | Very simple              | Minimal (no type hints for tasks)   | None (core Python)  | Lightweight, easy to read, minimal external dependencies, straightforward usage to manage tasks in a list.                      | Less type safety, no validation mechanism, uses print statements for listing tasks, not as flexible for expansions or testing.  |
| partial     | Python classes with an Enum for status     | Simple/Moderate          | Moderate (custom classes, no pydantic) | None (core Python)  | Clean separation of concerns (Task vs. TaskManager), flexible status management using enums, straightforward for expansions/test. | No built-in validation like pydantic, tasks identified only by references (no IDs), potential for growth but needs more scaffolding. |

### Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
   • The "fancy" style tends to produce a more sophisticated and production-ready module. It includes structured validation (via pydantic), comprehensive type hints, and docstrings in a consistent format. This makes it well-suited for projects that demand strong correctness, clarity, and scalability.  
   • However, if simplicity and a minimal dependency footprint are priorities, the "plain" style code may be easier to integrate. The "partial" style sits between these two extremes, providing a reasonable balance of clarity, typed usage of enums, and straightforward structure, while stopping short of pydantic-level validation.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?
   • Use of External Libraries & Validation:  
     – "fancy": Depends on pydantic, leverages advanced tooling like mypy validation.  
     – "plain": Uses no external libraries.  
     – "partial": No external libraries, but includes an Enum for statuses.  
   • Code Complexity & Readability:  
     – "fancy": More detailed structure (e.g., typed fields, creation timestamps, docstrings).  
     – "plain": Very minimal, easier for quick scripts.  
     – "partial": Splits responsibilities but no built-in validation, a middle ground.  
   • Handling of IDs, Timestamps, & Status:  
     – "fancy": Has an ID and a timestamp automatically assigned, uses a boolean for completion.  
     – "plain": No explicit ID, tasks are tracked by list position.  
     – "partial": No IDs or timestamps, uses an enum for status instead of a boolean.  

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?
   • All three outputs present a coherent solution for creating, updating, and listing tasks.  
   • Each code snippet follows standard Pythonic conventions in naming, indentation, and basic documentation.  
   • Task creation and completion are core functionalities in every style, and each approach allows retrieving or listing tasks in some form.  
   • Despite differing in complexity, all solutions reflect some application of “simple design heuristics,” ensuring code clarity and maintainability within each style’s scope.
