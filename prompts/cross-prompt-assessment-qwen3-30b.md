### 1. Super-Condensed Comparison Table

| Prompt Style | Code Complexity        | Documentation Detail              | Feature Set                              | Strengths                                                 | Weaknesses                                           |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| fancy        | High (enums, filters) | Extensive docstrings (Google style) | Full CRUD, filtering, status as Enum      | Very thorough, typed, and enterprise-grade (pydantic, Enum) | May be overkill for simple use cases                |
| medium       | Moderate              | Concise docstrings               | Basic CRUD, status field, simple updates | Balanced mix of simplicity and clarity                    | Less type enforcement (all dict-based)              |
| plain        | Simple (procedural)   | Brief inline docstrings          | Essential CRUD, file persistence         | Easy to read/maintain, straightforward approach           | Limited typed constraints and finer-grained control |

### 2. Extended Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?  
   - The “fancy” style output provides the most robust solution. It includes type hinting (via pydantic), enums for status handling, and thorough documentation. This aligns with best practices in larger or more complex projects where strict typing, validation, and clear docstrings are highly valued. If you need strong structure, data model validation, or plan to scale the application, the “fancy” style is ideal.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?  
   - • Data Model Representation:  
     - “fancy” uses pydantic (with an enum) for strict validation and formal status representation.  
     - “medium” uses a Python dict-based approach (with manual string statuses).  
     - “plain” defines a simple Task class with minimal structure.  
   - • Documentation Depth:  
     - “fancy” uses robust docstrings and explains each field, each method thoroughly.  
     - “medium” has a moderate level of docstring detail.  
     - “plain” uses more concise inline docstrings.  
   - • Features and Extensibility:  
     - “fancy” adds advanced filtering and clear, typed methods.  
     - “medium” offers a middle ground of features (task status filters, minimal type hints).  
     - “plain” focuses on basic CRUD plus file persistence.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?  
   - • Core Goal: All three versions manage tasks by adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting.  
   - • Clarity of Purpose: Each approach maintains a clear, easily understandable interface for basic task operations.  
   - • Separation of Concerns: Each keeps tasks logically grouped (in a list or with a class), and methods handle discrete operations (CR, UD).  
   - • Main Concepts: Every solution includes the idea of a “task” with a description or title, a way to mark completion, and a simple interface for listing tasks.  

Overall, the “fancy” prompt yields a highly structured, production-ready module. The “medium” prompt is balanced and straightforward, potentially a good default for moderate-scale projects. The “plain” prompt is minimalistic yet practical, suitable for quick prototypes or small, script-like usage.
