| Prompt Style | Code Complexity | Documentation/Comments | Data Validation | Output Formatting | Primary Strength | Potential Weakness |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Fancy        | High            | Detailed docstrings & guidelines | Uses pydantic for data validation | Follows strict style/formatting rules (flake8, black) | Very thorough instructions and well-structured code | May be verbose or overengineered for the simplest use cases |
| Plain        | Low             | Brief docstrings & simpler approach | Uses simple dictionary-based tasks, no pydantic | Minimal code layout, single Python class | Quick to understand and maintain | Lacks advanced features such as type checking and data validation |

## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   The "fancy" prompt style yields a codebase with more advanced features (e.g., use of pydantic, type hints, docstrings in Google format, and a thorough set of CRUD operations on tasks). It is more robust, follows strict linting conventions, includes type validation, and adheres to best practices such as immutability and unit testing readiness. This makes it more suitable for larger-scale production work where maintainability, correctness, and code clarity are paramount.

   On the other hand, the "plain" prompt style provides a lightweight and straightforward approach. It is easy to read and more than adequate for smaller projects or quick scripts. However, it lacks type hints and data validation, meaning it is slightly less robust in terms of error checking and maintainability in the long term.

   Overall, if you value production-ready code and in-depth documentation, "fancy" is superior. If you just want simple, minimal functionality in a hurry, "plain" is sufficient.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • The "fancy" output employs a class-based design with strict types, docstring formatting guidelines, thorough validations, and best practices such as immutability in the `update_task` method.  
   • The "plain" output uses a single class with a minimal approach (dictionary-based tasks with no special data validation or error handling beyond index range checks).  
   • The "fancy" style invests more lines of code to implement and document tasks comprehensively, while the "plain" style remains concise and removes many advanced elements like pydantic and custom exceptions.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • Both outputs define a class responsible for tracking tasks.  
   • Each approach allows adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.  
   • Both solutions show how to initialize a manager instance and handle tasks using similar method names.  
   • The general intent—managing tasks—remains the same, focusing on storing a to-do list, updating status, and admin tasks (e.g., deletion and listing).  

In conclusion, while both the "fancy" and "plain" styles share the same overarching goal—managing tasks—they vary in complexity, best practice implementation, and overall thoroughness.
