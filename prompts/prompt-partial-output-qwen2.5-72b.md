Certainly! Below is a Python module that manages a list of tasks following the baseline conventions you provided. This module includes functions to add, remove, and list tasks, as well as to mark tasks as completed.

### `task_manager.py`

```python
import uuid

class Task:
    def __init__(self, description):
        self.id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.description = description
        self.completed = False

    def mark_as_completed(self):
        self.completed = True

    def mark_as_incomplete(self):
        self.completed = False

    def __str__(self):
        status = "Completed" if self.completed else "Incomplete"
        return f"{status}: {self.description}"

class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    def add_task(self, description):
        """Add a new task to the list."""
        task = Task(description)
        self.tasks.append(task)

    def remove_task(self, task_id):
        """Remove a task by its ID."""
        self.tasks = [task for task in self.tasks if task.id != task_id]

    def mark_task_as_completed(self, task_id):
        """Mark a task as completed by its ID."""
        for task in self.tasks:
            if task.id == task_id:
                task.mark_as_completed()
                return
        raise ValueError(f"Task with ID {task_id} not found")

    def mark_task_as_incomplete(self, task_id):
        """Mark a task as incomplete by its ID."""
        for task in self.tasks:
            if task.id == task_id:
                task.mark_as_incomplete()
                return
        raise ValueError(f"Task with ID {task_id} not found")

    def list_tasks(self):
        """List all tasks, both completed and incomplete."""
        return [str(task) for task in self.tasks]

def main():
    # Example usage of TaskManager
    manager = TaskManager()
    
    manager.add_task("Buy groceries")
    manager.add_task("Do laundry")
    manager.add_task("Call the doctor")

    print("Initial tasks:")
    print("\n".join(manager.list_tasks()))

    task_id = manager.tasks[1].id
    manager.mark_task_as_completed(task_id)

    print("\nAfter marking a task as completed:")
    print("\n".join(manager.list_tasks()))

    manager.remove_task(task_id)

    print("\nAfter removing the completed task:")
    print("\n".join(manager.list_tasks()))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Code is communication**: The code is written to be clear and self-explanatory. Each function has a docstring that describes its purpose.
2. **Simple Design Heuristics**:
   - **All tests pass**: The module includes example usage in the `main` function, which can serve as a simple test case.
   - **Reveals intent**: The class and method names are descriptive and convey their purpose.
   - **No knowledge duplication**: Task IDs are generated uniquely using UUIDs to avoid conflicts.
   - **Minimal entities**: The design is kept minimal with only necessary classes and methods.
3. **Small, safe increments**: Each method performs a single responsibility, making the code easy to understand and maintain.
4. **Tests are the executable spec**: While not included in this example, you can write unit tests using a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.
5. **Compose over inherit**: The `TaskManager` class composes `Task` objects rather than inheriting from them.
6. **Functional core, imperative shell**: The business logic (adding, removing, marking tasks) is isolated in the `TaskManager` class, and the example usage in `main` serves as the "imperative shell".
7. **Psychological safety**: The code is designed to be clear and maintainable, promoting a safe environment for collaboration.
8. **Version-control etiquette**: Descriptive commit messages and branching strategies should be used when versioning this module.

This module provides a basic but extensible framework for managing tasks in Python. You can expand it with additional features or integrate it into a larger application as needed.
