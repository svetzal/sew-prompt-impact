## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   • “fancy” provides the most feature-rich and robust solution. It uses Pydantic for data validation, includes type hints, and follows best practices from the provided engineering principles. It also showcases advanced code design with docstrings, error handling, and a demonstration of usage (the main function).

   • However, "fancy" may be more than is needed for some simpler use cases. If you just need a quick script to manage tasks, the additional overhead of Pydantic and extra structures could feel heavy.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • Use of Pydantic (only in “fancy”).  
   • Level of detail in comments, docstrings, and code structure (most extensive in “fancy”).  
   • Amount of type hinting (extensive in “fancy,” minimal or absent in “plain,” partial coverage in “partial”).  
   • Demonstration code: “fancy” and “plain” provide runnable “main” methods with example usage; “partial” includes a brief code block but focuses on class definitions.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • All three styles implement basic operations to manage tasks (creation, listing, updating/marking completion, and removal).  
   • Each style uses Python classes or methods to encapsulate logic.  
   • Each solution keeps the logic relatively simple and easy to follow. Even the “fancy” version, while more sophisticated, is still approachable.  
   • All solutions demonstrate the code in a single-file module that can be imported or run, though the detail in examples varies.

Overall, “fancy” is best suited if you require strict validation, type safety, and a more robust architecture following advanced design principles. “plain” serves as a neat starting point for simpler tasks. “partial” strikes a middle ground, offering a clear OOP structure without the overhead of additional libraries.
