|-------------:|:------------------------------------------------|:----------------|:---------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fancy**    | Provides classes with type hints, includes tests, uses mypy/flake8/black for linting/formatting | High            | Comprehensive tests (pytest)     | Uses mypy, pytest, flake8, black, strict type coverage, docstrings |

| **Plain**    | Uses a single class managing tasks with direct I/O feedback | Low             | Demonstration only (no formal test file) | No mention of linting, type checking, or test frameworks        |

### Qualitative Analysis

1) Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
• The “Fancy” prompt style delivers the most robust and professional solution, providing comprehensive tooling (mypy, pytest, flake8, black), clear type hints, and a testing strategy that aligns with modern Python best practices. If you need a production-ready approach with strong engineering conventions, “Fancy” appears to be the best.

2) What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?
• The “Fancy” version emphasizes engineering practices such as type annotations, linting, formatting, and testing frameworks. This demonstrates a more formal approach suitable for scalable codebases.  
• The “Medium” prompt style also uses a class approach and outlines basic tests, but it is a bit simpler: it lacks the in-depth mention of type checking tools, though it still uses docstrings and a functional flow.  
• The “Plain” style is the most straightforward, focusing on immediate, user-facing functionality. It emphasizes direct usage, adding and removing tasks, and prints out results, but includes minimal or no mention of dedicated testing frameworks or code-quality tools.

3) What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?
• All three solutions provide a Python class or structure to manage tasks.
• They each offer methods to add tasks, remove tasks, and display tasks (in some form).  
• They all focus on usability and clarity, aligning with the basic requirement of “make a Python module that can manage a list of tasks.”
