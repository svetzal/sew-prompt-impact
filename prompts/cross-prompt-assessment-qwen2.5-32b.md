| Prompt Style | Code Structure Complexity | Validation Approach       | Testing Approach          | Type Annotations       | Docstrings          | Tooling & Linting Mentions              | Overall Strength               |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Fancy       | More layered (class-based with Pydantic) | Pydantic-based input validation | Includes in-code unit test function | Comprehensive type hints (Mypy compliant) | Google-style docstrings | Mentions Black, Flake8, Mypy explicitly | Highly robust and professional  |
| Plain       | Simpler functional structure (single class) | Basic checks only (no Pydantic) | Demonstrates usage example but no explicit test suite | Minimal or absent | Few/no docstrings | No direct mention, simpler environment setup | Easier onboarding, less tooling overhead |

Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
   • The "fancy" prompt style generally provides a more robust, professional-grade solution. It includes stricter validation (using Pydantic), comprehensive type hints, explicit testing, and integration with common Python development tools (Black, Flake8, Mypy). This leads to more maintainable, error-resistant code.  
   • The "plain" prompt style is simpler: it avoids additional dependencies and is easier for a quick start, but lacks the thoroughness and formal structure of the fancy version.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?
   • The fancy response devotes considerable attention to guiding principles (e.g., small safe increments, naming conventions), uses Pydantic for validation, includes docstrings, and integrates code linters and formatters. It also includes a basic test function.  
   • The plain response focuses on core functionality (add/remove/complete tasks) without additional tooling or typed data models. It provides a single class with simple dictionary-based tasks and minimal checks.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?
   • Both responses implement the requested task management functionality with methods to add, remove, and list tasks.  
   • They each showcase examples of how to create and manipulate the tasks within a Python script or module context.  
   • Both solutions ultimately achieve a working system for task management, ensuring the user can add tasks and, in some form, verify or remove them.
