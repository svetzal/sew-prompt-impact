## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?

   The "fancy" prompt style (using pydantic and thorough type hints) provides the most robust, production-ready solution. It handles data validation through pydantic and includes a complete demonstration of usage in the main() function. However, depending on the scenario, this complexity might be unnecessary or heavy if you do not require strict validation or you prefer to avoid third-party dependencies.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?

   • The "fancy" output uses pydantic, focusing on strong validation, advanced docstrings, and strict type coverage.  
   • The "plain" output opts for a simpler, no-dependencies approach and focuses on being easy to read and integrate.  
   • The "partial" output stands between the other two, using standard library dataclasses for moderate structure and built-in tests, without external dependencies.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?

   • They all produce a Task or equivalent class to store id, description, and completion status.  
   • Each includes a TaskManager (or similar) that stores tasks in-memory, with methods to add, remove, complete, and list tasks.  
   • All approaches provide a short demonstration or test harness in a main block, illustrating usage.  
   • Common best practices are broadly followed: reading like an explanation (revealing intent), using a single-purpose approach, and giving a straightforward API to manage tasks.
