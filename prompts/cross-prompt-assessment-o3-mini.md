| Prompt Style | Key Differences                                 | Strengths                                                           | Weaknesses                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| fancy        | Longer, more detailed instructions emphasizing Python engineering principles and code quality standards | Produces highly structured code with extensive docstrings, type hints, and adherence to standards | Potentially verbose, with extra overhead for simpler tasks |
| plain        | Simpler, shorter instructions with minimal elaboration on best practices                 | Concise, straightforward code that is quick to read and understand             | Less thoroughness, fewer advanced features such as type hints or validators |

Extended Qualitative Analysis:

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
   • The “fancy” prompt tends to produce a more polished, production-grade solution. It directs the model to incorporate engineering best practices, apply extensive type hints, docstrings, and adhere to style guidelines (e.g., psychologic safety, commits, flake8 compliance). For teams or users who value code clarity, maintainability, and deeper validation, “fancy” is more likely to be the better option.
   • The “plain” prompt yields usable code but with lighter focus on best practices. This approach is often suitable for rapid prototyping or simpler use cases where comprehensive docstrings, advanced type safety, or style guides are not the highest priority.

2. What aspects of the model's response differ between the different prompt styles?
   • Overall Code Complexity: The “fancy” output is more complex and adopts standardized Pythonic patterns (with pydantic, docstring format, style checks), whereas the “plain” output is simpler.
   • Validation and Error Handling: The “fancy” version includes pydantic validators to ensure data integrity (e.g., empty task description validation). The “plain” code does not utilize additional validation libraries.
   • Type Annotations: While both outputs can include type hints, the “fancy” prompt specifically enforces thorough type coverage with mypy checks.
   • Documentation: The “fancy” prompt yields comprehensive docstrings and usage examples, while the “plain” prompt’s docstrings are more minimal.

3. What aspects of the model's response are consistent across all prompt styles?
   • Core Functionality: Both versions allow adding, retrieving, updating, and listing tasks. They showcase a Task-like class or structure and a managing component or class for handling multiple tasks.
   • Code Readability: Although the “fancy” version is more detailed, both outputs remain understandable, reflecting Python’s straightforward syntax.
   • Overall Objective: Regardless of style, the model respects the request to create a module that manages tasks, providing methods to add, remove, and update tasks efficiently.
