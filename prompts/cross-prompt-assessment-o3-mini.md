## Qualitative Analysis

1. Which prompt style gives the best results overall?
   • The “best” style depends on context. For a robust, production‑ready codebase that includes data validation and clear documentation, the "fancy" style stands out. It uses Pydantic, has comprehensive docstrings, and methodically represents tasks with rich data models. If you need high reliability and typed validation, "fancy" is the most complete.
   • However, if you want a middle‑ground that includes inline tests and uses standard library features without external dependencies, the "medium" style balances simplicity and usefulness.
   • For quick proof‑of‑concepts or small script‑style needs, the "plain" style has the least overhead and is easiest to plug in or modify rapidly.

2. What aspects of the model’s response differ between the different prompt styles?
   • Code structure and organization: 
     – "Fancy" employs Pydantic and explicit docstrings, offering detailed documentation and strict data validation.  
     – "Medium" uses Python’s dataclasses and includes inline tests, emphasizing test‑driven design with a moderate level of complexity.  
     – "Plain" relies on dictionaries, keeping code minimal and straightforward.  
   • Testing approach: 
     – "Fancy" demonstrates usage through an example flow but does not have discrete tests.  
     – "Medium" includes test functions at the bottom that check correctness, effectively acting as an executable specification.  
     – "Plain" only includes basic usage examples, with no formal test harness.  
   • Dependency on external libraries: 
     – "Fancy" requires pydantic.  
     – "Medium" and "Plain" rely on standard library only.

3. What aspects of the model’s response are consistent across all prompt styles?
   • All styles provide core task management functionality: adding tasks, marking them complete, listing, and removing tasks.  
   • Each response outlines a clear, single‑responsibility interface where operations are distinct (e.g., add, remove, complete, list).  
   • They all demonstrate usage in a self‑contained module that can be run or imported.  
   • Each style meets the user’s basic request: “Make me a python module that can manage a list of tasks.”
